            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>Jennifer M., a 34-year-old elementary school teacher from Michigan, was looking for entertainment during her evening downtime. She'd played at several online casinos before but was frustrated with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Slow withdrawal times (7-14 days at previous casinos)</li>
                <li>Complicated bonus terms she couldn't understand</li>
                <li>Customer service that never responded</li>
                <li>Limited game selection</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>KEY INSIGHT:</strong> Jennifer almost didn't create an account because of past negative experiences. The transparent bonus terms and visible RTP percentages convinced her to give us a chance.
            </div>
            
            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <p>Jennifer joined [Casino Name] in March 2024 with a modest $50 deposit. Here's what made the difference:</p>

            </ul>
            
            <h3>2. High-Quality Game Selection</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2,500+ slots including her favorite: Book of Dead</li>
                <li>Verified RTP of 96.21% (she could see it before playing)</li>
                <li>Demo mode to practice without risking money</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>3. Supportive Experience</h3>
            <ul>

                "I literally couldn't believe it. I had to check the balance three times. I called customer support at 11 PM and they were so excited for me! The money was in my bank account by 5 AM the next morning. I've been to Vegas, I've played at other online casinos - nothing compares to this experience."

            </div>

            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>January 2024 data revealed a critical gap in our platform:</p>
            
            <div class="metrics-grid">
                <div class="metric-box">
                    <div class="metric-number">73%</div>
                    <div class="metric-label">Mobile Traffic</div>
                </div>
                <div class="metric-box">
                    <div class="metric-number">38%</div>
                    <div class="metric-label">Mobile Conversion</div>
                </div>
                <div class="metric-box">
                    <div class="metric-number">62%</div>
                    <div class="metric-label">Desktop Conversion</div>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <p><strong>The disconnect:</strong> While 73% of our traffic came from mobile devices, mobile conversion rate was 24 percentage points lower than desktop. We were losing 35% of potential mobile customers due to poor mobile experience.</p>
            
            <h3>Mobile User Complaints (From Support Tickets)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>"Buttons too small to click" (142 tickets)</li>
                <li>"Registration form doesn't work on phone" (98 tickets)</li>
                <li>"Games load too slowly" (87 tickets)</li>
                <li>"Can't deposit on mobile" (76 tickets)</li>
                <li>"Text too small to read" (54 tickets)</li>

            <h2>The Solution: Mobile-First Redesign</h2>
            <p>We committed to a complete mobile redesign with a "mobile-first" development philosophy.</p>
            
            <h3>Phase 1: Research & Planning (2 weeks)</h3>

            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>4. Mobile-Specific Features</strong></p>
